            <div>I got into tech &amp; design when I was around 15, building simple websites on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> over dial-up internet. </div>

            <div>These days, I spend most of time designing simple &amp; usable experiences for digital products. I design in Sketch and build things in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Recently, I've been playing around with React-based tech like React Native and React VR.</div>

            <div>While I'm not making stuff, I like to travel, learn/play some guitar or ponder about life.</div>
